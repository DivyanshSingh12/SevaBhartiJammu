            <p class = "par1">The Balwari program has been a motivation for the people in Sewa Bastis since its inception. Along with the wide-ranging development of the children, this program has also helped in the advancement of the people in the Sewa Bastis; for instance, informing women, boosting their self-confidence of women, and increasing the interest of girls in education, and completing one work while leaving children in Balwaris.</p>

            <h1 style="color: #E3FDFD">Balwari:</h1>
            <p class = "par1">As a part of the educational program, Sewa Bharti runs many educational projects, such as Sewa Dham Residential School, Gopal Dham Residential School, Senior Secondary School, and hundreds of Balwari centers across Delhi, wherein the children have imparted the values of Indian culture, besides primary education. These children come from underprivileged colonies and their parents send the children with high hopes and dreams in their eyes, that, these children will get the benefit of education and learn good values, which will help them become better citizens in life. They will become enlightened individuals and learn the importance of education and good values in life. Thus, it is very important to inculcate the habit of practicing good values at a very tender age. These Balwari’s are doing exceptionally good work of making the children understand the importance of studying and education.</p>

        <h1 style="color: #E3FDFD">Objectives</h1>
        <p class = "par1">Sewa Bharti’s focus is to raise the status of Balwari’s to a level, where, not only poor people, but even parents of middle class send their children to these Balwari’s. The idea is to decrease the rich-poor divide as much as possible and bring the children of all social strata together, so that it paves the way for a just and equitable society.</p>

            <p class = "par1">Provide primary education to the children</p>

            <h1 style="color: #E3FDFD">Operations</h1>
            <p class = "par1">There is a teacher and one governess in each Balwari. Governess looks after the children’s personal hygiene and cleanliness. While, the teacher will be responsible for creating awareness among the people in the bastis, so that more and more parents send their children to these Balwari’s. The performance of the teachers will be suitably reciprocated.</p>

            <h1 style="color: #E3FDFD">Impact of the Balwaris:</h1>
            <p class = "par1">The impact of these Balwari’s has been manifold. Due to the Balwari’s, children diverted their propensities toward education. Women, who otherwise have to look after the children by sparing time out of their work time, now can drop their children in Balwaris and accomplish a major part of their important tasks with undivided concentration. Many teachers have adopted many innovative methods of teaching by going to the Balwaris, so as to make it more easy and comprehensible. They have become a source of inspiration for other girls to go for education.</p>
